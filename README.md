# Roblox-Inventory-Shopper

# How To Use
   - enter an ID, NOT a username. An ID is the group of numbers you see when going on roblox.
      - eg. 1957038621
   - wait for the results to load
   - if this step takes longer than 2 minutes, there may be an error so you will have to either start again or contact me on github/roblox
